Let's move forward with the following approach and keep them in mind as our SOP:
- Strict Standard Format TypeDoc Comments for layman with Example usages.
- No `properties` to be defined in the interface as all properties should always be declared.
- All `properties` should always be declared `private`.
- All `properties` `private` should start with`_` eg. `rank`:`_rank`.
- Each `property` should always have a `public` getter eg. `_rank`:`getRank`.
- Each `property` should always have a `private` setter eg. `_rank`:`setRank`.
