/**
 * @class `Casino`
 * Represents a Casino environment that manages multiple poker rooms (`PokerRooms`).
 * This class handles operations related to room creation, listing, removal, and searching.
 *
 * #### Purpose
 * A Casino serves as a central hub for organizing poker games by managing rooms.
 * Each room can accommodate players and maintain its own game state.
 *
 * #### Extends
 * Additionally, it extends the Node.js `EventEmitter` to emit events when specific actions
 * occur, such as creating or removing a room.
 *
 * #### Implements
 * This class implements the `CasinoInterface` and inherits from the `EventEmitter` class,
 * allowing it to emit events and conform to the defined interface structure for consistency
 * and predictability.
 *
 * #### Events
 * The `Casino` class emits custom events to signal room-related actions. For instance,
 * when a room is created, an event `casino:roomCreated` is emitted, making it easy
 * to handle notifications or updates related to the Casino’s operations.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const casino = new Casino();
 * casino.on('casino:roomCreated', (room) => console.log(`Room created: ${room.name}`));
 * const room = casino.createRoom({ name: "Room1", tableSize: 6, smallBlind: 10, bigBlind: 20 });
 * console.log(room); // Logs details of "Room1"
 * ```

   * #### Access Level
   * This property is private, meaning it can only be accessed directly within the
   * `Casino` class itself. This encapsulation ensures that external modifications
   * to the list of rooms are controlled through the class’s public methods.
   *
   * #### Default Value
   * The `__rooms` property is initialized as an empty array `[]`, indicating that
   * the Casino starts with no rooms. Rooms are added to this array using the `createRoom`
   * or `addRoom` methods.
   *
   * @example
