/**
 * @interface `PokerRoomConfig`
 * Defines the configuration settings required to instantiate a `PokerRoom` in the Casino system. 
 * This configuration object provides essential information such as the roomâ€™s unique identifier, 
 * display name, and table settings. Designed to streamline the setup of poker rooms, this config 
 * helps standardize room creation and ensure consistent properties across different rooms.
 *
 * #### Purpose
 * The `PokerRoomConfig` serves as the blueprint for configuring `PokerRoom` instances, allowing
 * developers to initialize new rooms with standardized settings. This configuration ensures that 
 * each `PokerRoom` has all necessary properties predefined, making room setup efficient and reliable.
 *
 * #### Structure Overview
 * This interface includes:
 * - **Room Identification**: `id` and `name` properties for uniquely identifying and naming the room.
 * - **Table Configuration**: `tableConfig`, which defines core table settings such as size and blind values.
 *
 * #### Usage Context
 * The `PokerRoomConfig` is typically used as an input object for the `PokerRoom` constructor. By providing 
 * a well-defined structure for room settings, this config object helps prevent errors during room setup 
 * and enforces consistency across room instances.
 *
 * #### Requirements
 * Each `PokerRoomConfig` must specify:
 * - A valid `tableConfig` object, defining essential game settings.
 * - (Optional) A unique `id` and descriptive `name`, enhancing room identification.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const roomConfig: PokerRoomConfig = {
 *   id: "room42",
 *   name: "High Stakes",
 *   tableConfig: { tableSize: 6, smallBlind: 50, bigBlind: 100 }
 * };
 * const pokerRoom = new PokerRoom(roomConfig); // Initializes a new PokerRoom with the specified configuration
 * ```

interface PokerRoomConfig {
  /**************************************************************************************************************
   * PROPERTIES
   **************************************************************************************************************/

  /**
   * @property {string | undefined} id
   *
   * A unique identifier for the poker room. This `id` is used to distinguish each `PokerRoom` within
   * the Casino system, allowing for easy reference and management.
   *
   * #### Access Level
   * This property is intended for internal use within the Casino system, enabling unique identification
   * of each room instance. It may be accessed when updating or querying specific rooms.
   *
   * #### Default Value
   * The `id` property can be `undefined` if not initially assigned, indicating the room may not have been
   * uniquely identified upon creation. Once assigned, this value should remain unchanged to ensure room
   * consistency within the system.
   *
   * #### Requirements
   * - If provided, the `id` should be a non-empty string.
   * - The `id` must be unique across all rooms in the Casino to avoid conflicts.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const roomConfig: PokerRoomConfig = {
   *   id: "room1",
   *   name: "High Rollers",
   *   tableConfig: { tableSize: 6, smallBlind: 10, bigBlind: 20 }
   * };
   * console.log(roomConfig.id); // Output: "room1"
   * ```
   */
  id: string | undefined;

  /**
   * @property {string | undefined} name
   *
   * The name assigned to the poker room. This is used as an identifier in user interfaces or logs,
   * making the room more human-readable and manageable within the Casino system.
   *
   * #### Access Level
   * Accessible throughout the system for room referencing, display, and logging. Unlike `id`, `name` does not
   * have to be unique but should provide clear identification for the room.
   *
   * #### Default Value
   * If `undefined`, the room may be considered unnamed or generic. Assigning a name to the room can enhance
   * identification and help users or administrators differentiate between rooms in a Casino.
   *
   * #### Requirements
   * - Should be a non-empty string if defined to ensure the room has a readable label.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const roomConfig: PokerRoomConfig = {
   *   id: "room2",
   *   name: "VIP Suite",
   *   tableConfig: { tableSize: 8, smallBlind: 50, bigBlind: 100 }
   * };
   * console.log(roomConfig.name); // Output: "VIP Suite"
   * ```
   */
  name: string | undefined;

  /**
   * @property {PokerTableConfig} tableConfig
   *
   * Defines the table settings associated with the poker room. This configuration includes
   * essential settings such as `tableSize`, `smallBlind`, and `bigBlind` values that govern gameplay.
   *
   * #### Access Level
   * Accessible within the room and potentially by the Casino system, this property is essential for defining
   * the core table structure and game settings within the poker room.
   *
   * #### Requirements
   * The `tableConfig` should be defined when the room is created, as it specifies game rules.
   *
   * #### Default Value
   * `N/A` - Must be defined for every `PokerRoom` to ensure the game setup aligns with room specifications.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const roomConfig: PokerRoomConfig = {
   *   id: "room3",
   *   name: "Beginner's Lounge",
   *   tableConfig: { tableSize: 4, smallBlind: 5, bigBlind: 10 }
   * };
   * console.log(roomConfig.tableConfig);
   * // Output: { tableSize: 4, smallBlind: 5, bigBlind: 10 }
   * ```

/**
 * @interface `PokerRoomInterface`
 * Defines the responsibilities and structure for managing a `PokerRoom` within the Casino system. This interface is
 * essential for implementing operations such as room setup, player queue management, and table configuration, thereby
 * organizing and facilitating smooth poker game management.
 *
 * #### Purpose
 * The `PokerRoomInterface` serves as a standardized blueprint for any `PokerRoom` class, detailing essential methods
 * for room configuration, player management, and table access. By following this structure, the system ensures that each
 * poker room is identifiable, manageable, and consistent in functionality.
 *
 * #### Extends
 * This interface extends `NodeJS.EventEmitter` to allow event-driven management of room actions like table updates,
 * player entry, or exit events, enhancing flexibility in asynchronous operations across the Casino system.
 *
 * #### Methods Overview
 * The `PokerRoomInterface` includes essential methods for:
 * - **Setting Attributes**: Define or update the room name, player queue, and table settings.
 * - **Retrieving Information**: Access current room attributes like ID, name, player queue, and table configuration.
 * - **Event-Driven Management**: Inherits from `NodeJS.EventEmitter`, supporting event emissions for actions related
 *   to room state changes, providing other components within the system with timely updates on key actions.
 *
 * #### Events
 * The `PokerRoomInterface` supports event emissions for significant room-related actions. This enables external components
 * to subscribe to updates, making it easier to manage changes dynamically within the Casino environment.
 *
 * #### Usage
 * This interface is designed to standardize the management of `PokerRoom` instances, offering a complete structure for
 * both client-facing interactions (like displaying room details) and internal operations (like seating players or adjusting
 * tables).
 *
 * @extends NodeJS.EventEmitter
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const pokerRoom: PokerRoomInterface = new PokerRoom();
 * pokerRoom.on('roomUpdated', () => console.log(`Room updated with new settings`));
 * pokerRoom.setName("HighRollers");
 * console.log(pokerRoom.getName()); // Logs "HighRollers"
 * ```
