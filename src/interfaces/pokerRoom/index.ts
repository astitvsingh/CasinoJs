/**
 * @interface `PokerRoomConfig`
 * Represents the configuration settings necessary to create a `PokerRoom` within the Casino system.
 * This interface outlines essential properties such as a unique identifier, room name, and a set of table configurations,
 * ensuring standardized room setup and consistent properties across all instances.
 *
 * #### Purpose
 * `PokerRoomConfig` is intended to streamline the creation and initialization of `PokerRoom` instances,
 * providing a pre-defined structure for necessary properties. This configuration standardization simplifies
 * room management and improves overall code clarity.
 *
 * #### Structure Overview
 * This interface includes:
 * - **Room Identification**: `id` and `name` properties for unique identification and naming of the room.
 * - **Table Configurations**: `tableConfigs`, an array that specifies one or more configurations for tables within the room.
 *
 * #### Usage Context
 * `PokerRoomConfig` is typically utilized as a parameter for the `PokerRoom` constructor, ensuring that
 * each room is initialized with consistent, complete settings. By using this config object, developers can avoid
 * common setup errors and maintain uniformity across different rooms in the Casino system.
 *
 * #### Requirements
 * Each `PokerRoomConfig` object must:
 * - Provide a valid `tableConfigs` array, containing configuration details for each table within the room.
 * - Optionally specify a unique `id` and `name`, enhancing room distinction and readability.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const roomConfig: PokerRoomConfig = {
 *   id: "room42",
 *   name: "High Stakes",
 *   tableConfigs: [
 *     { tableSize: 6, smallBlind: 50, bigBlind: 100 },
 *     { tableSize: 8, smallBlind: 100, bigBlind: 200 }
 *   ]
 * };
 * const pokerRoom = new PokerRoom(roomConfig); // Initializes a new PokerRoom with the specified configuration
 * ```

/**
 * @interface `PokerRoomInterface`
 * Defines the responsibilities and structure for managing a `PokerRoom` within the Casino system. This interface is
 * essential for implementing operations such as room setup, player queue management, and table configuration, thereby
 * organizing and facilitating smooth poker game management.
 *
 * #### Purpose
 * The `PokerRoomInterface` serves as a standardized blueprint for any `PokerRoom` class, detailing essential methods
 * for room configuration, player management, and table access. By following this structure, the system ensures that each
 * poker room is identifiable, manageable, and consistent in functionality.
 *
 * #### Extends
 * This interface extends `NodeJS.EventEmitter` to allow event-driven management of room actions like table updates,
 * player entry, or exit events, enhancing flexibility in asynchronous operations across the Casino system.
 *
 * #### Methods Overview
 * The `PokerRoomInterface` includes essential methods for:
 * - **Setting Attributes**: Define or update the room name, player queue, and table settings.
 * - **Retrieving Information**: Access current room attributes like ID, name, player queue, and table configuration.
 * - **Event-Driven Management**: Inherits from `NodeJS.EventEmitter`, supporting event emissions for actions related
 *   to room state changes, providing other components within the system with timely updates on key actions.
 *
 * #### Events
 * The `PokerRoomInterface` supports event emissions for significant room-related actions. This enables external components
 * to subscribe to updates, making it easier to manage changes dynamically within the Casino environment.
 *
 * #### Usage
 * This interface is designed to standardize the management of `PokerRoom` instances, offering a complete structure for
 * both client-facing interactions (like displaying room details) and internal operations (like seating players or adjusting
 * tables).
 *
 * @extends NodeJS.EventEmitter
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const pokerRoom: PokerRoomInterface = new PokerRoom();
 * pokerRoom.on('roomUpdated', () => console.log(`Room updated with new settings`));
 * pokerRoom.setName("HighRollers");
 * console.log(pokerRoom.getName()); // Logs "HighRollers"
 * ```
