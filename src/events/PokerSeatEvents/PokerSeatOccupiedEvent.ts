/**
 * @interface `PokerSeatOccupiedEvent`
 *
 * Represents an event structure for when a `PokerSeat` becomes occupied by a player.
 * Extends `_BaseEvent` to inherit a standardized format, allowing consistent event data
 * encapsulation within the library.
 *
 * #### Purpose
 * The `PokerSeatOccupiedEvent` interface is specifically designed to capture and emit
 * information whenever a seat is occupied in a poker game, enabling listeners to react
 * to seat occupancy changes in real-time.
 *
 * #### Extends
 * Extends `_BaseEvent` to inherit core metadata (`head`) and payload (`data`) structures,
 * adding more specific information about the occupied seat for subscribers.
 *
 * #### Structure
 * - `head`: Contains core metadata, including `name` and `createdAt` to mark the event type and timestamp.
 * - `data`: Customizable details specific to the `PokerSeatOccupiedEvent`, such as player ID or seat number.
 *
 * #### Usage
 * `PokerSeatOccupiedEvent` is emitted each time a player occupies a seat in the game.
 * This interface supports additional key-value pairs in both `head` and `data` for flexibility
 * in extending event details if necessary.
 *
 * @extends _BaseEvent
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const event: PokerSeatOccupiedEvent = {
 *   head: { name: "PokerSeat:Occupied", createdAt: new Date(), customMeta: "extra metadata" },
 *   data: { seatId: "12345", playerId: "p7890", customField: "additional details" }
 * };
 * console.log(event);
 * // Console Output: { head: { name: "PokerSeat:Occupied", createdAt: <Date>, customMeta: "extra metadata" }, data: { seatId: "12345", playerId: "p7890", customField: "additional details" } }
 * ```

    /**
     * @property {string} name
     *
     * Represents the name of the event, used for identifying the specific type of `PokerSeatOccupiedEvent`.
     *
     * #### Purpose
     * Used to label and identify the event as a `PokerSeatOccupiedEvent` for listeners or subscribers.
     *
     * #### Requirements
     * - Should be set to a descriptive value, e.g., `"PokerSeat:Occupied"`.
     *
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * const eventName = event.head.name;
     * console.log(eventName);
     * // Console Output: "PokerSeat:Occupied"
     * ```

    /**
     * @property {Date} createdAt

     * #### Purpose
     * Provides a reliable way to track the event occurrence timing, useful in time-sensitive
     * scenarios such as logging or auditing seat occupancy changes.
     *
     * #### Requirements
     * - Must be a valid `Date` object representing the eventâ€™s emission time.
     *
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * const eventTime = event.head.createdAt;
     * console.log(eventTime);
     * // Console Output: <Date>
