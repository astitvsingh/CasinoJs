/**
 * @interface `_BaseEvent`
 *
 * Represents a foundational structure for events emitted within the library, ensuring consistency
 * across event types by including both metadata (`head`) and event-specific payload (`data`) sections.
 *
 * #### Purpose
 * The `_BaseEvent` interface establishes a standardized structure for all events across the library.
 * It is designed to be extended by specific event types, providing core fields while supporting extensibility
 * for additional metadata and payload properties. The `_BaseEvent` structure ensures that all events are
 * easy to identify, track, and extend as needed by various components within the library.
 *
 * #### Structure
 * - **head**: Contains key metadata, including the event's name, creation timestamp, and other optional
 *   fields like status and priority. These fields offer essential tracking and categorization data for the event.
 * - **data**: Carries dynamic content specific to each event, allowing derived event interfaces to add
 *   event-relevant details that can be processed by listeners.
 * - **Extensibility**: Both the `head` and `data` sections can support optional additional properties, making
 *   it possible to adapt the structure for a range of scenarios. The `_BaseEvent` interface itself allows
 *   sibling properties to be added as needed by extending interfaces.
 *
 * #### Usage
 * `_BaseEvent` provides the foundation for defining any event within the library. It is intended to be
 * extended by event-specific interfaces that may introduce additional fields within `data`. In this way,
 * `_BaseEvent` serves as a flexible base for creating a wide variety of standardized events across the
 * libraryâ€™s features.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const event: _BaseEvent = {
 *   head: { name: "Casino:RoomCreated", createdAt: new Date(), customMeta: "extra metadata" },
 *   data: { customData: "event-specific details" },
 *   customSibling: "additional info"
 * };
 * console.log(event);
 * // Console Output: { head: { name: "Casino:RoomCreated", createdAt: <Date>, customMeta: "extra metadata" }, data: { customData: "event-specific details" }, customSibling: "additional info" }
 * ```

    /**
     * @property {string} id
     *
     * Unique identifier for the event instance, ensuring traceability across emitted events.
     *
     * #### Purpose
     * Used for tracking the event instance, especially useful in scenarios with multiple simultaneous events.
     *
     * #### Requirements
     * - Should be a unique string.
     *
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * const eventId = event.head.id;
     * console.log(eventId);
     * // Console Output: "unique-id-1234"
     * ```

     *
     * #### Purpose
     * Used by event listeners to filter and categorize events.
     *
     * #### Requirements
     * - Should be a descriptive name that provides a clear indication of the event's purpose,
     *   such as `"Casino:RoomCreated"` or `"PokerSeat:Occupied"`.
     *
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * const eventName = event.head.name;
     * console.log(eventName);
     * // Console Output: "Casino:RoomCreated"

     * Used for tracking the exact time of event emission, which is essential for sequencing,
     * logging, and auditing purposes.
     *
     * #### Requirements
     * - Should be a valid `Date` object.
     *
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * const creationTime = event.head.createdAt;

     * #### Purpose
     * Useful for tracking updates to the event after initial creation, particularly in cases
     * where the event's data might change as it is processed.
     *
     * #### Optional
     * - This field is optional and should be a valid `Date` object if present.

     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * const modificationTime = event.head.lastModifiedAt;
     * console.log(modificationTime);

     *
     * #### Optional
     * - Possible values include `"initiated"`, `"in-progress"`, `"completed"`, or custom statuses.

     * #### Purpose
     * Helps in prioritizing event handling, especially when multiple events are emitted
     * and processed in sequence.
     *
     * #### Optional
     * - This field is optional, and values can range from `0` (lowest) to any positive integer.
